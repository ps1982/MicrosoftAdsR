# MicrosoftAdsR
Bings Ads Reporting 

# Introduction
This project was created to call the microsoft ads api and download the report programmatically given Mcirosoft's lack of functionality and options in terms of report delivery. 

At the moment this downloads the file into a CSV but could easily be adjusted to load the data into a data frame if needed.

Open to any suggestions on how to improve - it's by no means a finished or polished solution but it's been working for 12 months now with no issues!

# Pre-Requisites
The use the MicrosoftAdsR package you will need to have access to Microsoft Ads and you will need to know the Client ID, Client Secret and the API Developer Token. 

# Acknowledgement
The basis of this project came from the RBingsAds package by Deepesh Goel.
